# Seneca's Evening Review

> End each day with honest self-examination. Not self-criticism. Learning.

---

## The Practice

**When:** Evening, before bed

**Time:** 5 minutes

**Source:** Seneca, *On Anger* Book 3

---

## The Three Questions

1. **What did I do well today?**
   - Progress, kindness, alignment with values
   - Give yourself credit

2. **Where did I go wrong?**
   - Not for self-flagellation
   - For learning and adjustment
   - Honest but not harsh

3. **What could I do better tomorrow?**
   - Specific, actionable
   - One thing to try differently

---

## How to Do It

Write freely or just think. The key is honesty without judgment.

Seneca's version: "I hide nothing from myself, I pass nothing by. Why should I fear any of my errors, when I may say: 'See that you do not do this again; I forgive you this time.'"

---

## Why It Works

- Creates a learning loop (not just doing, but reviewing)
- Balances self-criticism (question 2) with self-credit (question 1)
- Forward-looking (question 3 prevents rumination)
- Daily practice compounds into self-knowledge

---

## Variations

**Pattern tracking:** After a week, look back. What keeps showing up in "where I went wrong"?

**Add gratitude:** Before or after the three questions.

**Rose/Thorn/Bud:** What went well (rose), what was hard (thorn), what you're looking forward to (bud).

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping the "what went well" part
- Turning "where I went wrong" into self-attack
- Being vague ("do better") instead of specific ("respond slower when frustrated")
- Not actually changing anything based on insights

## Source

Seneca wrote: "When the light has been taken away and my wife has fallen silent... I pass the whole day in review before my own eyes and measure my deeds and words."

The Stoics practiced this daily. Marcus Aurelius did it in the morning (his *Meditations* are morning prep). Seneca did it at night. Both work.

*Used in /end-day daily. See [Stoicism](../frameworks/stoicism.md) for the full philosophy.*
