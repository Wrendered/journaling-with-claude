## How This Folder Works

Reference material and personal results are separate:

| Type | Public Reference | Personal Results |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Framework | `frameworks/[name].md` | `private/assessments/[name].md` |
| Assessment | `assessments/[name].md` | `private/assessments/[name].md` |
| Daily Practice | `daily-practices/[name].md` | (tracked in journal and dashboard) |
| Exercise | `exercises/[name].md` | `private/assessments/[name].md` |

**Process:**
1. Add something (`/add-framework`) or take an assessment
2. Update Status table above
3. Create `[name].md` with detailed results and reflections
4. Add summary to `self-map.md` Self-Knowledge section
5. Dashboard will reference this index for what's pending
