> Ancient philosophy focused on virtue, wisdom, and accepting what you can't control. Practical daily practices for resilience.

## Core Concept

**The dichotomy of control:** Some things are in our control (our judgments, actions, responses), some are not (other people, external events, outcomes). Peace comes from focusing energy on what's in our control.

Key insight: *It's not events that disturb us, but our judgments about events.*

## Key Principles

### 1. Focus on What You Control
- Your thoughts, judgments, intentions, actions
- Not: Other people, outcomes, circumstances, the past

### 2. Virtue is the Only Good
- Wisdom, courage, justice, temperance
- External things (money, status, pleasure) are "preferred indifferents" — nice to have, not necessary for a good life

### 3. Negative Visualization (Premeditatio Malorum)
- Imagine what could go wrong
- Not to worry, but to prepare and appreciate
- "What if I lost this?" → Gratitude for having it now

### 4. Amor Fati (Love of Fate)
- Accept and even embrace what happens
- Every obstacle is an opportunity
- "The impediment to action advances action" — Marcus Aurelius

### 5. Memento Mori (Remember Death)
- Life is finite
- Urgency and perspective come from remembering mortality
- "You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think." — Marcus Aurelius

## Daily Practices

### Morning Preparation (Marcus Aurelius Style)

At day's start, reflect:

1. **What difficulties might I face today?**
   - "I will meet with interference, ungrateful people, the arrogant, the deceitful..."
   - Prepares you so you're not knocked off balance

2. **What is in my control?**
   - My responses, my effort, my character
   - Not outcomes, others' reactions, external events

3. **What virtues do I want to embody today?**
   - Patience, courage, kindness, focus?
   - Set an intention

4. **What am I grateful for?**
   - Could lose it all today — appreciate what is

### Evening Review (Seneca Style)

At day's end, ask:

1. **What did I do well today?**
   - Progress, kindness, alignment with values
   - Give yourself credit

2. **Where did I go wrong?**
   - Not for self-flagellation
   - For learning and adjustment
   - "What bad habit have I curbed? What virtue practiced?"

3. **What could I do better tomorrow?**
   - Specific, actionable
   - One thing to try differently

### Throughout the Day

**Pause before reacting:**
- Something upsets you → Pause
- Ask: "Is this in my control?"
- Ask: "What would the wise response be?"

**Negative visualization (micro):**
- Before complaining about something, imagine not having it
- "What if I couldn't work at all? What if I had no home?"

**The View from Above:**
- Zoom out: your problem in the context of your city, your country, the planet, the universe
- Perspective on what actually matters

## Key Exercises

### The Stoic Fork
When facing any challenge:
1. Is this in my control?
2. **If yes:** Take action, don't complain
3. **If no:** Accept it, focus elsewhere

### Voluntary Discomfort
Occasionally practice mild hardship:
- Cold showers
- Fasting
- Sleeping on the floor
- Walking instead of driving

Purpose: Build resilience, reduce attachment to comfort, prove you can handle difficulty.

### Journaling Prompts
- What would I do if I weren't afraid?
- What am I avoiding that I know I should do?
- What do I have right now that I'd miss if it were gone?
- If I only had one year to live, what would I change?
- What would my best self do in this situation?

## Stoic Responses to Common Challenges

| Challenge | Stoic Reframe |
|-----------|---------------|
| Someone criticizes me | "Their opinion is outside my control. Is there truth I can learn from?" |
| I failed at something | "I control my effort, not outcomes. What can I learn?" |
| I'm anxious about the future | "The future doesn't exist yet. What can I do NOW?" |
| I'm angry at someone | "They acted according to their nature. My anger only harms me." |
| I feel overwhelmed | "What is the ONE next action in my control?" |
