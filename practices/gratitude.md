# Gratitude Practice

> Notice what's good. Not toxic positivity. Deliberate attention to what you have.

---

## The Practice

**When:** Morning or evening (works either way)

**Time:** 2 minutes

**The question:** "What am I grateful for right now?"

---

## How to Do It

1. List 3 things you're grateful for
2. Be specific (not "my family" but "the conversation I had with Mom yesterday")
3. Feel it, don't just list it. Pause on each one.

---

## Variations

**Why gratitude:** After each item, add "because..." Forces specificity.

**New gratitude:** Only things you haven't listed before. Prevents autopilot.

**Gratitude for difficulties:** What challenge taught you something? What obstacle made you stronger?

**Negative visualization (Stoic version):** Imagine losing something you have. Notice the gratitude that arises.

## Why It Works

Research-backed benefits:
- Shifts attention from what's missing to what's present
- Reduces comparison and envy
- Improves sleep (evening gratitude)
- Builds resilience

The mechanism: You get more of what you pay attention to. Attention to good things trains the brain to notice more of them.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Going through the motions without feeling it
- Always listing the same things
- Using it to suppress legitimate negative emotions
- Skipping on hard days (when it matters most)
