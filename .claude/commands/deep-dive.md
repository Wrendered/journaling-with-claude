# /deep-dive [topic]

> Extended exploration of a specific theme, pattern, decision, or question. Longer than daily rituals, shorter than `/onboarding`.

## When to Use

- Processing something that came up in daily reflection
- Exploring a pattern that keeps recurring
- Working through a specific decision
- Refining an assessment profile (e.g., "Do these Enneagram results actually fit?")
- Connecting current feelings to history/patterns

## Flow

### 1. Set the Focus
What are we exploring? Options:
- A **pattern** (e.g., "Why do I keep avoiding this decision?")
- A **decision** (e.g., "Career change — let's actually dig in")
- An **assessment** (e.g., "Let's calibrate my Enneagram type")
- A **feeling** (e.g., "I've been anxious all week — what's underneath?")
- A **theme** (e.g., "My relationship to achievement")

### 2. Surface Relevant Context
I pull from:
- `history/` theme files — What have you written about this before?
- `self-map.md` — Known patterns, self-knowledge
- `assessments/` — Relevant framework results
- Recent weekly journal — Current week's Raw Log and summaries

**Key move:** Quote your own words back to you. "In March 2018 you wrote: '...'"

### 3. Explore Together
Depending on the topic:
- **Pattern work:** When does this show up? What triggers it? What's the payoff?
- **Decision work:** What's actually blocking this? What would each choice cost/give?
- **Assessment calibration:** "Does this description fit? Give me a recent example where it did/didn't."
- **Feeling work:** What framework lens helps here? (Shame/vulnerability? Stoic reframe? Enneagram pattern?)

### 4. Synthesize
- What did we learn?
- What's the update to your self-understanding?
- Any action items?

### 5. Capture
- Session notes → Weekly journal (`private/journal/YYYY-Www.md`) under today's date
- Profile updates → `self-map.md` or `assessments/`
- New patterns → Potentially add to `history/` theme files
- When weekly review happens, key insights become Highlight Quotes

## Example: Calibrating Enneagram Type

**User:** `/deep-dive` — I want to test my Enneagram results

**Assistant:**
Your assessment suggested Type 3 (Achiever) with a 4 wing. The core pattern is: "Self-worth tied to achievement and recognition. Difficulty being present without producing."

**Does that fit?** Can you give me a recent example where this showed up — or one where it didn't?

**User:** [shares example]

**Assistant:** That tracks / That's interesting — sounds more like [X]. Let me update your profile with this nuance...

## Example: Exploring a Pattern

**User:** `/deep-dive` — Why do I keep not deciding on [major life decision]?

**Assistant:**
Let me pull what you've written about this...

From your journal (6 months ago): "I keep saying I'll decide next month..."
From last year: "Both options seem fine, which is the problem."
From years ago: "I'd rather have someone else make big choices so I can complain if it's wrong versus be responsible."

**Pattern:** Decision avoidance on high-stakes questions has been running for years.

What feels true about this? What doesn't?

## Relationship to History

The `history/` folder exists FOR these sessions. Daily rituals are light; deep dives are when we mine the treasure trove.

| Ritual | History Usage |
|--------|---------------|
| `/start-day` | Rarely — maybe surface a relevant quote |
| `/end-day` | Note if something connects to a theme |
| `/monologue` | Capture raw, process later |
| `/deep-dive` | **Primary use** — pull quotes, patterns, context |
| `/onboarding` | Full review across all history |

## Duration

Expect 15-45 minutes. Can be done anytime, but works well on:
- Tuesday (Framework exploration day)
- Friday (Integration day)
- Weekend (Journal processing time)
