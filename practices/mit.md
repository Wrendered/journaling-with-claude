# MIT (Most Important Thing)

> Start each day by identifying the one thing that matters most.

---

## The Practice

**When:** Morning, before checking email or messages

**Time:** 2 minutes

**The question:** "If I could only accomplish one thing today, what would make today feel successful?"

---

## How to Do It

1. Before the day's noise starts, pause
2. Ask: What's the ONE thing that would make today worthwhile?
3. Write it down
4. Commit: This gets done before anything else (or at least before anything optional)

---

## Why It Works

- Forces prioritization instead of reactive busyness
- Creates clarity when everything feels urgent
- Gives you a win even on chaotic days
- Prevents the "I was busy but accomplished nothing" feeling

---

## Common Mistakes

- Picking something easy instead of important
- Picking three MITs (defeats the purpose)
- Picking something you can't control ("Get client to approve")
- Not protecting time for it

---

## Variations

**MIT + 2:** One must-do, two should-dos. Still prioritized.

**Time-blocked MIT:** First 90 minutes of work = MIT only.

**MIT check-in:** Mid-day, ask "Have I done my MIT yet? If not, when?"
