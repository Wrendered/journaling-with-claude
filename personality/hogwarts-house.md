# Hogwarts House

> Cultural shorthand for values. Not science. Just fun.

---

## The Four Houses

| House | Values | Shadow Side |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Gryffindor** | Courage, daring, nerve, chivalry | Recklessness, showboating, hero complex |
| **Slytherin** | Ambition, cunning, resourcefulness, leadership | Ruthlessness, ends-justify-means thinking |
| **Ravenclaw** | Wisdom, creativity, curiosity, wit | Detachment, overthinking, intellectual elitism |
| **Hufflepuff** | Loyalty, patience, hard work, fair play | Conflict avoidance, doormat tendencies, undervaluing self |

## Why This Is Here

It's not science. The Big Five is science. This is cultural shorthand.

But millions of people use house identity as a quick signal for values and self-concept. "I'm such a Ravenclaw" means something in conversation. It's a shared vocabulary.

## How to Use It

- **Self-reflection:** Which values do you actually prioritize? Which shadow side do you fall into?
- **Quick read:** When someone tells you their house, you learn something about how they see themselves.
- **Don't take it seriously:** It's a children's book. Hold it loosely.
