# Brene Brown — Vulnerability & Shame Resilience

> "Vulnerability is not winning or losing; it's having the courage to show up and be seen when we have no control over the outcome."

---

## Core Concept

**Worthiness:** The belief that you are enough, right now, as you are. Not when you achieve more, please more, or perfect more.

**Key distinction:**
- **Guilt** = "I did something bad" (behavior-focused, can be productive)
- **Shame** = "I am bad" (identity-focused, always destructive)

## Shame Resilience Theory (4 Elements)

When shame hits:

1. **Recognize shame & its triggers** — Physical signs: chest tightness, face flush, shrinking. What activated it?
2. **Practice critical awareness** — Reality-check the messages. "Is this expectation realistic? Whose voice is this?"
3. **Reach out** — Shame thrives in secrecy. Connect with someone who's earned the right to hear your story.
4. **Speak shame** — Name it: "I'm feeling shame right now." This strips its power.

## The Three Types of Armor

How we protect ourselves from vulnerability:

| Armor | How it shows up | The lie it tells |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Perfectionism** | Over-preparing, not starting until "ready," harsh self-criticism | "If I'm perfect, I can avoid criticism and blame" |
| **Numbing** | Scrolling, overworking, overeating, staying busy | "I can selectively numb pain without losing joy" |
| **Foreboding Joy** | Waiting for the other shoe to drop, "dress-rehearsing tragedy" | "If I don't let myself feel joy, disappointment won't hurt as much" |

**Note:** Perfectionism is shame's favorite hiding spot. It rides shotgun while fear drives.

## The 10 Guideposts for Wholehearted Living

Each pairs something to cultivate with something to let go:

| # | Cultivate | Let Go Of |
|---|-----------|-----------|

| 2 | Self-compassion | Perfectionism |
| 3 | Resilient spirit | Numbing and powerlessness |
| 4 | Gratitude and joy | Scarcity and fear of the dark |
| 5 | Intuition and faith | The need for certainty |
| 6 | Creativity | Comparison |
| 7 | Play and rest | Exhaustion as status symbol, productivity as self-worth |
| 8 | Calm and stillness | Anxiety as a lifestyle |
| 9 | Meaningful work | Self-doubt and "supposed to" |
| 10 | Laughter, song, dance | Being cool and always in control |

## Rising Strong Process

For recovering from setbacks, failures, and hard emotions:

1. **The Reckoning** — Notice the emotion. Get curious: "What am I feeling? What triggered this?"
2. **The Rumble** — Identify the story you're telling yourself. "The story I'm making up is..." Then reality-test it.
3. **The Revolution** — Write a new ending. Integrate what you learned into how you live.

## Key Exercises

### Living Into Your Values
1. Circle 15 values from a list that resonate
2. Narrow to your **2 core values**
3. Operationalize: "What does practicing this value look like in daily life?"
4. Check: "Where am I living into this? Where am I not?"

### DIG Deep (End of any guidepost work)
- **D**eliberate — What intention do I bring?
- **I**nspired — What resonates?
- **G**oing — What's the first small step?

### Armor Check (Morning)
"Which armor am I reaching for today?"
- Perfectionism?
- Numbing?
- Foreboding joy?

### The Pause (In the moment)
When emotionally activated, pause and ask: "What's happening beneath my reaction?"
