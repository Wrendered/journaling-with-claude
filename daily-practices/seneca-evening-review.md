# Evening Review

> End each day with honest self-examination. Not self-criticism. Learning.

---

## The Practice

**When:** Evening, before bed
**Time:** 5 minutes
**Origin:** Pythagorean (~500 BC), adapted by Seneca (~50 AD)

---

## The History

This practice is older than Seneca. The Pythagoreans (~500 BC) practiced evening self-examination as part of their spiritual discipline. Their version from the *Golden Verses*:

> "Admit not sleep into your tender eyelids / Till you have reckoned up each deed of the day — / How have I erred, what done or left undone?"

Seneca adapted this in *On Anger* (Book III), describing his nightly practice:

> "When the light has been removed and my wife has fallen silent, aware of this habit that's now mine, I examine my entire day and go back over what I've done and said, hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing by."

The modern "What did I do well? Where did I go wrong?" version is a loose adaptation popularized by productivity writers (Tim Ferriss, Ryan Holiday). It's valid, but it shifted the focus from **virtue cultivation** to **performance improvement**.

## Two Versions

### Version A: Virtue-Focused (Original Seneca)

1. **What bad habit did I resist today?**
2. **What fault did I stand against?**
3. **In what way am I better?**

*Use when:* You want to work on your moral self. Focus on character, not productivity.

### Version B: Performance-Focused (Modern Adaptation)

1. **What did I do well today?**
2. **Where did I go wrong?**
3. **What could I do better tomorrow?**

*Use when:* You want practical self-improvement. Focus on actions and outcomes.

### Version C: Pythagorean (Duty-Focused)

1. **How have I erred?**
2. **What have I done?**
3. **What duty have I omitted?**

*Use when:* You want accountability around responsibilities and commitments.

## How to Use in /end-day

Rotate between versions, or pick one that fits your current season:

| Day | Version | Focus |
|-----|---------|-------|
| Mon/Thu | Virtue (A) | Character work |
| Tue/Fri | Performance (B) | Practical improvement |
| Wed | Pythagorean (C) | Duty and commitments |
| Sat/Sun | Skip or light | Rest |

Or just use whichever resonates in the moment.

## How to Do It

Write freely or just think. The key is honesty without judgment.

Seneca: "I hide nothing from myself, I pass nothing by. Why should I fear any of my errors, when I may say: 'See that you do not do this again; I forgive you this time.'"

---

## Why It Works

- Creates a learning loop (not just doing, but reviewing)
- Balances self-criticism (question 2) with self-credit (question 1)
- Forward-looking (question 3 prevents rumination)
- Daily practice compounds into self-knowledge

---

## Variations

**Pattern tracking:** After a week, look back. What keeps showing up in "where I went wrong"?

**Add gratitude:** Before or after the three questions.

**Rose/Thorn/Bud:** What went well (rose), what was hard (thorn), what you're looking forward to (bud).

---

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping the "what went well" part
- Turning "where I went wrong" into self-attack
- Being vague ("do better") instead of specific ("respond slower when frustrated")
- Not actually changing anything based on insights

---

## Source

Seneca wrote: "When the light has been taken away and my wife has fallen silent... I pass the whole day in review before my own eyes and measure my deeds and words."

The Stoics practiced this daily. Marcus Aurelius did it in the morning (his *Meditations* are morning prep). Seneca did it at night. Both work.

*Used in /end-day daily. See [Stoicism](../frameworks/stoicism.md) for the full philosophy.*
