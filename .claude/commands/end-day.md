description: Evening review. Captures wins, lessons, and patterns.
---

## Context

Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

Read silently: `private/self-map.md`, `private/dashboard.md`

## Pulse Check

Start with: "How are you feeling? (One word is fine, rambling is fine too.)"

Just receive it. Note energy level for pattern tracking.

## Ask

Then: "How'd the day go?"

Let them talk. Don't ask 5 questions.

## Follow up (maybe)

One question if needed:
- "Did you get your one thing done?"
- "What got in the way?"
- "Anything carrying to tomorrow?"

Or nothing.

## Evening Reflection

**Check CLAUDE.md → Daily Rituals → Evening** for this user's configured reflection questions.

**If not configured** (still has `Option A/B/C` template text, or section is missing):
- Say: "Your evening reflection isn't configured yet. Want to set it up now, or skip for today?"
- If yes: Walk through the configuration flow from `/onboarding` → "Configure Daily Rituals" section
- If skip: Just capture what they shared and close

**If configured:** Use whatever they've set (Seneca's questions, gratitude, nothing, etc.).

## Habit Check (if tracking habits)

Glance at `dashboard.md` Habits section:
- Did they show up for their keystone habits today?
- If yes: Update streak, acknowledge briefly
- If missed: "Never miss twice. What's the 2-minute version for tomorrow?"

Don't belabor this — quick check, move on.

## Update

**Always update weekly journal (`private/journal/YYYY-Www.md`):**
- Append to today's entry in Raw Log:
  ```markdown
  **Evening:** Feeling: [pulse]. [what happened, how it went, reflection responses if any]
  ```
- Quote important words verbatim
- Note patterns, wins, or blocks

**Update `private/dashboard.md`:**
- Clear completed items from queue
- Update habit streaks if tracking

**Update `private/self-map.md` only if:**
- New long-term pattern discovered
- Mission clarity changed

## Surface patterns

If pattern (3x+):
- "You've mentioned [X] a few times. Worth naming?"
- "That's the third day you [pattern]. What's going on?"

If they hit MIT multiple days:
- "That's [N] days in a row. What's working?"

If they missed MIT:
- "What got in the way?" — no guilt

## Close

Short:
- "Rest."
- "Tomorrow: [their next thing if set]"
- Connect to mission if appropriate
