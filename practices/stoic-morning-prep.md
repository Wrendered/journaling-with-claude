# Stoic Morning Prep

> Prepare for the day by anticipating difficulties. Not pessimism. Readiness.

---

## The Practice

**When:** Morning, after MIT

**Time:** 5 minutes

**Source:** Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* Book 2

---

## The Questions

1. **What difficulties might I face today?**
   - Meetings, people, tasks, emotions
   - "I may meet with interference, ungrateful people, the arrogant..."

2. **What is in my control?**
   - My responses, my effort, my character
   - Not: outcomes, others' reactions, external events

3. **What virtue do I want to embody today?**
   - Patience, courage, kindness, focus, calm?
   - Pick one intention

4. **What am I grateful for?**
   - Could lose it all today. Appreciate what is.

## Why It Works

- Difficulties don't catch you off guard
- You've already decided how to respond
- Separates what you control from what you don't
- Sets a character intention, not just a task list

---

## Example

> Today I have meetings with two people who frustrate me. I can't control their behavior, but I can control my patience and responses. I want to embody calm today. I'm grateful I have work that challenges me.

---

## Short Version (1 min)

Just ask: "What might go wrong today, and how will I respond?"

---

## Source

Marcus Aurelius wrote his *Meditations* as morning reflections. The famous passage:

> "Begin the morning by saying to yourself: I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil."

The point: prepare, don't be surprised, respond with virtue anyway.
