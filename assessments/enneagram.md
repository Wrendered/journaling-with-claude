# Enneagram

> Ancient personality system describing nine types, each with core motivations, fears, and growth paths.

---

## Core Concept

The Enneagram isn't just about behavior — it's about **motivation**. Two people can act identically but be different types based on WHY they do it.

Each type has:
- A **core fear** they organize life to avoid
- A **core desire** they pursue
- A **direction of integration** (growth under health)
- A **direction of disintegration** (stress behavior)

The goal isn't to change your type — it's to become a **healthy version** of your type and integrate qualities from all types.

## The Nine Types

| Type | Name | Core Fear | Core Desire |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **1** | The Perfectionist | Being bad, corrupt, defective | Integrity, being good |
| **2** | The Helper | Being unwanted, unworthy of love | Being loved, needed |
| **3** | The Achiever | Being worthless, without value | Being valuable, successful |
| **4** | The Individualist | Having no identity, no significance | Being unique, authentic |
| **5** | The Investigator | Being useless, incompetent | Being capable, competent |
| **6** | The Loyalist | Being without support, guidance | Having security, support |
| **7** | The Enthusiast | Being trapped in pain, deprivation | Being satisfied, fulfilled |

## Wings and Arrows

### Wings
You have access to the types on either side of yours. One is usually dominant.
- Example: Type 3 might have a 2 wing (3w2: "The Charmer") or 4 wing (3w4: "The Professional")

### Arrows (Integration/Disintegration)
Each type moves toward two other types:
- **Integration (growth):** When healthy, you take on positive qualities of another type
- **Disintegration (stress):** When stressed, you take on negative qualities of another type

Example for Type 3:
- Integration → 6: Becomes more loyal, team-oriented, committed
- Disintegration → 9: Becomes passive, checked out, numb

## The 27 Subtypes

Each type has three variants based on **instinctual focus**:
- **Self-Preservation (SP):** Security, comfort, health, resources
- **Social (SO):** Group belonging, status, contribution
- **Sexual/One-to-One (SX):** Intensity, connection, attraction

This creates 27 distinct profiles with specific growth paths.
