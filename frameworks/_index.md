# Frameworks

> Lenses for framing problems. Think of it like: if you were talking to the author, how would they approach this?

---

## Quick Reference

| Framework | Type | Best For |
|-----------|------|----------|
| [Atomic Habits](atomic-habits.md) | Behavior system | Building habits, identity-based change |
| [Stoicism](stoicism.md) | Philosophy | Daily resilience, perspective, letting go |
| [Brene Brown](brene-brown.md) | Psychology | Shame, worthiness, vulnerability |

---

## When to Reach For What

**Want to build or break habits?** Atomic Habits. Identity-based change, small steps, systems over goals.

**Need daily resilience or perspective?** Stoicism. Focus on what you control, accept what you can't.

**Struggling with shame, perfectionism, or vulnerability?** Brene Brown. Name the armor, speak the shame.

## How Frameworks Differ from Other Folders

| Folder | What it is | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **`frameworks/`** | Lenses for framing problems | Reference as needed |
| `daily-practices/` | Morning/evening journaling rituals | Daily/weekly |
| `assessments/` | External quizzes you take | Every 6-12 months |
| `exercises/` | Guided deep work | Every 6-12 months |

Frameworks inform everything else. Stoicism gives us the Evening Review (daily practice). Brene Brown gives us Values Clarification (exercise). But you can use the practice without adopting the whole philosophy.

## Adding Frameworks

Use `/add-framework` to research and add any author, book, or concept:

```
/add-framework Getting Things Done
/add-framework Cal Newport
/add-framework Nonviolent Communication
```

Claude will research it and route it to the correct folder.

*Three frameworks included. Add more as you explore.*
