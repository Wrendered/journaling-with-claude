## How Personality Typing Differs from Frameworks

| Type | What it is | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Frameworks** | Life philosophies or behavior systems | Stoicism, Atomic Habits |
| **Personality** | Maps of who you are, not what to do | Enneagram, MBTI |
| **Practices** | Specific exercises you do | Morning prep, evening review |

Personality systems help you understand patterns and motivations. They're not prescriptive. The goal is awareness, not change.

## Adding Personality Systems

```
/add-framework Myers-Briggs
/add-framework Big Five
/add-framework StrengthsFinder
```

Claude will research it and add it to this folder.
