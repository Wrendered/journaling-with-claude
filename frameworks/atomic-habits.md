# Atomic Habits

> Framework by James Clear for building good habits and breaking bad ones through small, consistent changes.

**Book:** *Atomic Habits* by James Clear (2018)

## Core Concept

**Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.** Getting 1% better every day leads to remarkable results over time. Getting 1% worse leads to decline.

The key insight: **Focus on systems, not goals.** Goals are about the results you want. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. You don't rise to the level of your goals — you fall to the level of your systems.

## Identity-Based Habits

The most powerful driver of behavior change is identity. There are three layers of change:

| Layer | Focus | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Outcomes** | What you get | "I want to lose 20 pounds" |
| **Processes** | What you do | "I want to run every day" |
| **Identity** | What you believe | "I am a runner" |

**Start with identity.** Ask: "Who is the type of person who could get this outcome?"

- Don't say "I want to read more" — say "I am a reader"
- Don't say "I want to exercise" — say "I am someone who doesn't miss workouts"
- Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become

## The Four Laws of Behavior Change

Habits form through a loop: Cue → Craving → Response → Reward

To build a good habit, make it:
1. **Obvious** (Cue)
2. **Attractive** (Craving)
3. **Easy** (Response)
4. **Satisfying** (Reward)

To break a bad habit, invert:
1. **Invisible** (hide the cue)
2. **Unattractive** (reframe the craving)
3. **Difficult** (add friction)
4. **Unsatisfying** (add consequences)

## The Four Laws: Detailed

### 1. Make It Obvious

**Implementation intention:** "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."
- "I will meditate for 5 minutes at 7am in my kitchen."

**Habit stacking:** "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."
- "After I pour my morning coffee, I will write my MIT for the day."

**Environment design:** Make cues for good habits visible.
- Want to read more? Put the book on your pillow.
- Want to drink more water? Put a glass on your desk.

**To break a habit:** Reduce exposure to the cue.
- Want to check your phone less? Leave it in another room.

### 2. Make It Attractive

**Temptation bundling:** Pair something you need to do with something you want to do.
- "I will only listen to my favorite podcast while exercising."

**Join a culture where your desired behavior is the norm.**
- Want to run? Join a running club.
- We imitate the habits of: the close, the many, the powerful.

**Reframe your mindset:** "I have to" → "I get to"
- "I have to wake up early" → "I get to wake up early"

### 3. Make It Easy

**Reduce friction:** Decrease the number of steps between you and good habits.
- Want to exercise in the morning? Sleep in your workout clothes.

**Two-Minute Rule:** When starting a new habit, it should take less than 2 minutes.
- "Read before bed" becomes "Read one page"
- "Run 3 miles" becomes "Put on my running shoes"
- Master the habit of showing up before you optimize.

**Prime your environment:** Prepare in advance.
- Set out your journal the night before.
- Prep your coffee maker.

**Increase friction for bad habits:**
- Want to watch less TV? Unplug it after each use.
- Want to use social media less? Delete apps from your phone.

### 4. Make It Satisfying

**Immediate rewards matter more than delayed rewards.**
- The brain prioritizes immediate gratification.
- Add immediate pleasure to habits with delayed benefits.

**Habit tracking:** Mark an X on a calendar. Don't break the chain.
- Visual measure of progress
- Satisfying to see the streak grow
- "Never miss twice" — if you miss once, get back immediately

**Habit contract:** Create accountability with stakes.
- Tell someone your commitment.
- Add a cost to breaking the commitment.

## Key Tactics

### The Two-Minute Rule

Scale any habit down to two minutes:

| Desired Habit | Two-Minute Version |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Read more | Read one page |
| Study | Open my notes |
| Run 5K | Put on running shoes |
| Fold laundry | Fold one item |
| Journal | Write one sentence |

The point is to master showing up. A habit must be established before it can be improved.

### Habit Stacking Formula

```
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].
```

Examples:
- After I sit down with my morning coffee, I will write in my journal.
- After I finish dinner, I will put my phone in another room.
- After I close my laptop at end of day, I will write my MIT for tomorrow.

### Never Miss Twice

Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

Bad days happen. The goal isn't perfection — it's getting back on track quickly.

## Plateau of Latent Potential

Habits often don't show results for a while. Clear calls this the "Valley of Disappointment" — where you expect linear progress but get delayed results.

**Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions that built up potential.**

Like an ice cube that stays solid at 25°F, 26°F, 27°F... 31°F — then melts at 32°F. The work wasn't wasted — it was being stored.

## Integration with Daily Practice

### Morning (/start-day)

Use habit stacking to link MIT to existing routine:
- "After I [morning routine step], I will set my MIT."

Ask identity-based questions:
- "What would the person I'm becoming do today?"
- "What's one small thing I can do to vote for that identity?"

### Evening (/end-day)

Review habit performance:
- Did I show up for my keystone habits?
- If I missed, what got in the way? (environment, friction, cue?)
- What's one adjustment for tomorrow?

Use "never miss twice" as checkpoint.

### Weekly (/weekly-review)

Check habit systems:
- Are my habits still aligned with who I want to become?
- What's working? (Keep doing)
- What's not working? (Adjust the system, not just effort)
- Any new habits to start with the 2-minute version?

## Key Questions

**For starting habits:**
- What's the 2-minute version?
- What can I stack it after?
- How can I make the cue obvious?
- How can I make it satisfying immediately?

**For breaking habits:**
- How can I make the cue invisible?
- How can I add friction?
- What's the underlying craving? Can I address it differently?

**For identity:**
- Who is the type of person who could achieve this?
- What would that person do right now?
- How can I cast a vote for that identity today?
