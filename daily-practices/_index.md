## How Daily Practices Differ from Other Folders

| Folder | What it is | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| `frameworks/` | Lenses for framing problems | Reference as needed |
| **`daily-practices/`** | Morning/evening journaling rituals | Daily/weekly |
| `assessments/` | External quizzes you take | Every 6-12 months |
| `exercises/` | Guided deep work | Every 6-12 months |

Daily practices are short prompts you use as part of `/start-day` and `/end-day`. They take 2-5 minutes and become part of your routine.

---

## Example Rotation

Configure `/start-day` and `/end-day` to use these on a rotating schedule. Edit `CLAUDE.md → Daily Rituals` to set your preferences.

**Example morning rotation:**

| Day | Morning Practice |
|-----|-----------------|
| Mon/Thu | Stoic Morning Prep |
| Tue/Fri | Values Check-in |
| Wed | Gratitude |
| Sat/Sun | Lighter (MIT only) |

**Example evening:** Evening Review (daily)

*Or skip the rotation entirely and just set MIT in the morning, capture the day in the evening. Your choice.*

## Adding Practices

Use `/add-framework` with a journaling method:

```
/add-framework Bullet Journal
/add-framework Five Minute Journal
```

Claude will research it and add it to this folder.
