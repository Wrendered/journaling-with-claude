# Values Check-in

> Pause to ask: Am I pointed at what actually matters to me?

---

## The Practice

**When:** Morning or during weekly review

**Time:** 3 minutes

**The question:** "Am I living in alignment with my values right now?"

---

## How to Do It

1. Know your values (if you haven't clarified them, do that first)
2. Pick one or two core values
3. Ask: "How am I living into this value? Where am I not?"
4. If misaligned: What's one small adjustment?

---

## Example

> My core value is "presence." This week I've been distracted and rushing through conversations. One adjustment: Put phone in another room during dinner.

---

## If You Don't Know Your Values

Try Brene Brown's exercise:
1. Review a [list of values](https://brenebrown.com/resources/dare-to-lead-list-of-values/)
2. Circle 15 that resonate
3. Narrow to 2 core values
4. Operationalize: What does living this value look like day-to-day?

---

## Why It Works

- Values are the compass; this practice checks the compass
- Catches drift before it becomes a crisis
- Connects daily actions to deeper meaning
- Prevents "successful but unfulfilled" syndrome

---

## Variations

**Weekly values review:** Instead of daily, check alignment once a week in `/weekly-review`.

**Values-based decision filter:** When facing a choice, ask "Which option is more aligned with my values?"

**Gap analysis:** Rate 1-10 how aligned you are with each core value. Where's the biggest gap?

---

## Common Mistakes

- Too many values (pick 2-3, not 10)
- Values you think you should have vs. values you actually have
- Never operationalizing (knowing "authenticity" matters but not what it looks like)
- Checking values but never adjusting behavior

---

## Source

Values clarification appears in multiple frameworks: ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), Brene Brown's work, leadership development. The core idea is ancient: know what matters, align your life with it.
