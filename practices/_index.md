## How Practices Differ from Frameworks

| Type | What it is | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Frameworks** | Life philosophies or behavior systems | Stoicism, Atomic Habits |
| **Personality** | Maps of who you are | Enneagram, MBTI |
| **Practices** | Specific exercises you do | Morning prep, evening review |

Frameworks inform practices. Stoicism gives us Seneca's Evening Review. But you can use the practice without adopting the whole philosophy.

## Example Rotation

You can configure `/start-day` and `/end-day` to use these practices on a rotating schedule. Edit `CLAUDE.md → Daily Rituals` to set your preferences.

**Example morning rotation:**

| Day | Morning Practice |
|-----|-----------------|
| Mon/Thu | Stoic Morning Prep |
| Tue/Fri | Values Check-in |
| Wed | Gratitude |
| Sat/Sun | Lighter (MIT only) |

**Example evening:** Seneca's Evening Review (daily)

*Or skip the rotation entirely and just set MIT in the morning, capture the day in the evening. Your choice.*

## Adding Practices

```
/add-framework Morning Pages

/add-framework Five Minute Journal
```

Claude will research it and add it to this folder.
