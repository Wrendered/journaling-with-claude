## For Search Agents

### Quick Orientation (read first)

Every weekly file has these sections at the top — read these to find relevant timeframes:

1. **Summary** — 2-4 sentences: major themes, what happened
2. **Highlight Quotes** — Exact words that capture something important

### Deep Search

- **Raw Log** section contains timestamped daily entries
- Grep for keywords, names, themes
- Optional sections (Keywords, Patterns, Relationships, etc.) may help narrow

### Cross-Reference

- `history/_index.md` — Historical journals (if imported)
- `self-map.md` — Stable long-term patterns
- `assessments/` — Framework-specific insights
