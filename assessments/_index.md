## How Assessments Differ from Other Folders

| Folder | What it is | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| `frameworks/` | Lenses for framing problems | Reference as needed |
| `daily-practices/` | Morning/evening journaling rituals | Daily/weekly |
| **`assessments/`** | External quizzes you take | Every 6-12 months |
| `exercises/` | Guided deep work | Every 6-12 months |

**Assessments vs Exercises:**
- **Assessments** = Take an external quiz, get a type/score (Big Five, Enneagram)
- **Exercises** = Follow guided steps, produce an artifact (values, mission statement)
