## Why 2 Values?

Brene Brown is strict about this: more than two dilutes their power. "If everything is important, nothing is important." Two values you actually live by beat ten you forget.

## Step 2: Narrow to 2 (10 min)

This is the hard part. From your 15, pick 2 core values.

Questions to help:
- Which of these do I need to feel like myself?
- Which would I defend even if it cost me?
- When I'm at my best, which of these am I living?
- If I could only keep 2, which would they be?

Your 2 core values:
1. _____________
2. _____________

---

## Step 3: Define What They Mean to You (5 min)

For each value, write 1-2 sentences about what it means *to you*. Not the dictionary definition. Your definition.

**Value 1:** _____________ means...

**Value 2:** _____________ means...

---

## Step 4: Operationalize (10 min)

For each value:

### Value 1: _____________

**3 behaviors that support this value:**
1.
2.
3.

**3 slippery behaviors (things I do when I'm NOT living this value):**
1.
2.
3.

### Value 2: _____________

**3 behaviors that support this value:**
1.
2.
3.

**3 slippery behaviors:**
1.
2.
3.

---

## Step 5: Store Your Results

Copy your answers to `private/assessments/values.md`. Include:
- Your 2 core values
- Your definitions
- Supporting behaviors
- Slippery behaviors
- Date completed

---

## Using Your Values

Once clarified, your values become:

**Decision filter:** "Does this align with [value 1] and [value 2]?"

**Daily check-in:** Add to morning or evening ritual: "Did I live my values today?"

**Accountability:** When you catch yourself in a slippery behavior, pause. What's the aligned behavior?

**Revisit:** Every 6-12 months, redo this exercise. Values can shift.
