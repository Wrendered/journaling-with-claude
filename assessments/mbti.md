# Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

> 16 personality types based on four dichotomies. Popular, useful for conversation, scientifically shaky.

---

## The Four Dimensions

| Dimension | Poles | What it measures |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **E/I** | Extraversion / Introversion | Where you get energy |
| **S/N** | Sensing / Intuition | How you take in information |
| **T/F** | Thinking / Feeling | How you make decisions |
| **J/P** | Judging / Perceiving | How you organize your life |

Combine them for 16 types: INTJ, ENFP, ISTP, etc.

## The Caveats (Read This)

**MBTI has real scientific problems:**

- **~50% of people get different results on retest.** The binary categories (E vs I) force continuous traits into boxes. Most people are somewhere in the middle.
- **Weaker than Big Five.** Big Five is roughly twice as accurate for predicting life outcomes and has decades more validation.
- **Missing neuroticism.** One of the most important personality dimensions (predicts mental health, life satisfaction) isn't measured.
- **No predictive validity.** Doesn't reliably predict job performance, relationship success, or other outcomes.

**Why it's still here:** People love it. The 16 types give accessible language for talking about differences. It's useful as a conversation starter, not a scientific assessment.

## How to Use It

- **Hold it loosely.** Your type is a rough sketch, not an identity.
- **Use for communication.** "I'm more introverted" is useful. "I'm an INTJ so I can't do small talk" is not.
- **Don't hire or date by type.** It doesn't predict compatibility or performance.
- **Prefer Big Five for serious self-work.** Use MBTI for casual self-reflection.

## Compared to Other Systems

| System | Scientific Validity | Best For |
|--------|---------------------|----------|
| **Big Five** | Strong | Accurate trait measurement |
| **MBTI** | Weak | Accessible language, conversation starter |
| **Enneagram** | Weak | Deep motivation, growth paths |

MBTI overlaps with Big Five but less accurately. If you want science, use Big Five. If you want depth, use Enneagram. MBTI sits in between as cultural shorthand.
