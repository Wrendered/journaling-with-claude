Wait.

## Response Guide

| They're... | You... |
|------------|--------|
| On track | "Good. Keep going." |
| Off track | "Is this your one thing?" |
| Stuck | "What's the blocker?" |
| Procrastinating | "What's the resistance?" |
| Venting | Listen, then "Want me to save that?" |
| Lost | "What actually matters right now?" |
| On fire | Stay out of the way |

## Update (if needed)

Only if something changed:
- Update MIT or add blocker to `dashboard.md` queue
- Append to weekly journal if capturing something significant

## Close

Fast:
- "Back to it."
- "[X] days left."
