## How This Folder Works

1. When a decision emerges, create a file: `[decision-name].md`
2. Use the template in `_template.md` as a starting point
3. Track status here in the index
4. Use `/deep-dive [decision]` for extended exploration sessions
5. When decided, move to "Decided" section with outcome and date

## Weekly Decision Review

Do this once per week (default Friday, moveable):

1. Review each open decision file
2. For each: Has anything changed? Any new deadlines? Want to work on it?
3. Update urgency/status
4. Pick 1-2 for next week's decision work
